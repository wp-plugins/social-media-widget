Using your favorite sftp client, navigate to wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/custom. Within this folder you'll see three more 16/32/64. 

Depending on your icon size, toss your icons into one of those folders using the same naming scheme as the other icon packs (see the other packs for that information).

From within the widget control panel, select custom as the icon pack, and whatever widget size you put the custom icons in.

If you have any other question, please contact me via my SMW Support Forum.
